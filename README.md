## Day 1 - Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors

**Concepts:**
- Vector = 1D array
- Matrix = 2D array
- Tensor = nD array

**Hands-on:**
- Dot product (manual vs NumPy)
- Matrix multiplication (manual vs NumPy)
- Broadcasting example

## Day 2 - Derivatives, Gradients, and Gradient Checking

**Concepts:**
- Derivative = rate of change (slope)
- Chain rule = used in backpropagation
- Gradient = vector of partial derivatives
- Gradient checking = sanity check

**Hands-on:**
- Computed derivative of f(w) = w^2 + 3w + 1 at w=2
- Verified using finite difference method
- Wrote general Python function for numerical derivative
